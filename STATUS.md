# Solana Dashboard Project Status

## Completed Work

1. **Project Reorganization**
   - Created a well-structured, modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
   - Implemented proper error handling and validation
   - Set up API clients, database repositories, and data services

2. **Architecture Design**
   - Designed a layered architecture with API, service, and repository layers
   - Created reusable components for common operations
   - Implemented configuration management and environment variable support

3. **API Integration**
   - Built Shyft API client for Solana blockchain data
   - Created services for wallet and liquidity pool data
   - Implemented data formatting and transformation

4. **Database Integration**
   - Created Supabase client for database operations
   - Designed schemas for wallet, pool, position, deposit, withdrawal, and claim data
   - Implemented repositories for database operations

5. **Testing**
   - Created test scripts for wallet and liquidity data
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Added validation for all inputs

## Items to Complete

1. **API Key Configuration**
   - Replace placeholder API key with a valid Shyft API key
   - Update .env file with required credentials

2. **Database Setup**
   - Create required tables in Supabase
   - Set up appropriate indexes and constraints

3. **UI Integration**
   - Connect the dashboard API to the bolt.new UI
   - Create UI components for displaying wallet and liquidity data

4. **Additional Features**
   - Implement data caching to reduce API calls
   - Add user authentication for protecting wallet data
   - Create scheduled jobs for regular data updates

## Next Steps

1. Obtain a valid Shyft API key and update the .env file
2. Complete the Supabase database setup with the required tables
3. Begin integration with the bolt.new UI
4. Implement data refresh scheduling

## Known Issues

1. The Shyft API wallet/tokens endpoint is currently returning 404 errors
2. Supabase tables need to be created before database operations will work
3. Test pool address may need to be updated with a valid pool address
